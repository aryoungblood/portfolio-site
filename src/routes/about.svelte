<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  I design and build digital storytelling products. From data visualizations to
  interactives to animations, I explore the possibilities of digital
  communication with interdisciplinary teams. I work at every stage of the
  creative process, including concept development, ideation, wireframing,
  prototyping, visual design, and front-end development.
